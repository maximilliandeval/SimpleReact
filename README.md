# SimpleReact

This is a simple demonstration of 4 different ways in which web page modules can be built without spinning up a local server like Node.js (FKA just "Node") while avoiding CORS errors:
1. React
2. JSX with React (uses @babel/standalone)
3. Pure JavaScript
4. Preact

To test, all you have to do is open `simple.html` with your preferred web browser; you do not need to download anything.
